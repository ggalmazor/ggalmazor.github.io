## About me

Here's a picture of me while someone's talking to me:

### Some relevant things I've made in the past

I was one of the founders of <span class="false-link">katayunos.com</span> (currently out of service), a free periodic gathering of software developers to hone testing skills.

I collaborated on [a paper about illegal fishing on the west coast of Africa](https://odi.org/en/publications/western-africas-missing-fish-the-impacts-of-illegal-unreported-and-unregulated-fishing-and-under-reporting-catches-by-foreign-fleets/) in 2016, co-authored a follow-up paper about [China's distant waters fishing fleet](https://odi.org/en/publications/chinas-distant-water-fishing-fleet-scale-impact-and-governance/) in 2020, and co-authored a follow-up paper about [estimating the impact of illegal, irregular and unregulated fishing in five countries](https://odi.org/en/publications/fishy-business/) in 2024.

I once dressed up like a soprano and gave a software development talk with some friends.
